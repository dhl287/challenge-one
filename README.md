# Challenge-One

## Description

This challenge required me to to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible for people with disabilities on behalf of a marketing agency. I need to ensure that web accessibility is established across the site without changing the functionality of the website. The existing code will be improved through the use of HTML semantics and updating the stylesheet. I was able to practice how to use and update HTML and CSS and create a README.

## Installation

The website provided was an existing site that is intended to function the same before and after refactoring. My responsibility is to create a new repository on gitHub, commit and push any changes to the repository, and deploy to GitHub Pages to view the website live. The updates to the code are available on index.html, located in the main folder and style.css, located in the assets folder.

## Usage

The website will be deployed with better web accessibility and consolidated and easy-to-interpret code. When you click the items on the navigation bar, the page will move to the appropriate section.

## Credits

[The GitHub Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) was used to create the README template.

I also worked with [Frank Romero](https://github.com/FROMERO63) on refactoring the existing code but worked independently in making any further changes and drafting the README.
